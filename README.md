# ECON498_Final

# Introduction
This code is meant to convert a .json dataset to .csv, then run a RandomForest model and Linear Regression model on the dataset, then use the RandomForest model to predict the review count stars.

# Installation
To install this code, run 'git clone https://github.com/bbargar/ECON498_Final.git' in your terminal.

Other codes needed for installation, run this code:

'python3 pip install numpy pandas sklearn'

# Code Progression
To understand this code's progression, it can be simply stated in four steps.
'STEP 1': Convert all necessary datasets to .csv
'STEP 2': Run a RandomForest model on the dataset
'STEP 3': Run a Linear Regression model on the dataset
'STEP 4': Choose the best trained model, amend and run a prediction model on the dataset to achieve the necessary predicted data
